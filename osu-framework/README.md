A game framework written with osu! in mind.

# Requirements

- A desktop platform which can compile .NET 4.5.
- Visual Studio 2015 (community or otherwise) is recommended.

# Objectives

This framework is intended to take steps beyond what you would normally expect from a game framework. This means things like basic UI elements, text rendering, advanced input handling (textboxes) and performance overlays are provided out-of-the-box. Any of the osu! code that is deemed useful to other game projects will live in this framework project.

- Anywhere we implement graphical components, they will be displayed with a generic design and will be derivable for further customisation.
- Common elements used by games (texture caching, font loading) will be automatically initialised at runtime.
